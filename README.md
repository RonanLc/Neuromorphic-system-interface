# Neuromorphic System Interface

![Cover picture](/Data/Cover_picture.png)

## 🌍 Project background

This project was carried out during an internship abroad at the [Institute of Industrial Science](https://www.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/), the University of Tokyo. Its main objective was to develop software for communicating, exchanging and analyzing data with a neuromorphic chip.

### What is a neuromorphic chip?

Neuromorphic chips are circuits inspired by the functioning of the human brain. They simulate biological neural networks, making them particularly effective for tasks such as pattern recognition or machine learning. They can be seen as analog computers.

## 🎯 Project 

The aim was to design a graphical interface to:
1. Exchange commands with the neuromorphic chip.
2. Visualize data in real time.
3. Analyze results for scientific experiments.

## 🚀 What I did

### Programming the graphical interface (Python)

The main part of my work involved structure and programming in Python. The [Graphic](https://github.com/RonanLc/Neuromorphic-system-interface/tree/main/Graphic) directory contains the following elements:

- **User interface**: Developed with libraries like `Tkinter` or similar for intuitive interaction.

- **Communication management**:
  - Scripts to send and receive commands to/from the chip.
  - Specific protocols to ensure reliable exchanges.

- **Data visualization** :
  - Modules to display graphs in real time.
  - Analysis of chip responses using statistical tools.

### File structure
- `main.py` : Entry point to launch the application.
- `data_handler.py` : Management of incoming and outgoing data files.
- `interface.py` : Definition of the graphical interface and user interactions.
- `visualizer.py` : Generates and updates graphics in real time.

## 📂 Project organization

1. **Chip communication**: Protocols for configuring parameters, sending signals and retrieving results.
2. **Data analysis**: Extraction and interpretation of responses to validate performance.
3. **Visualization**: Creation of an interactive, user-friendly interface.

## 📈 Perspectives

This project paves the way for in-depth research into human-machine interaction via neuromorphic systems. The graphical interface enables researchers to better exploit the capabilities of neuromorphic chips in complex environments.
